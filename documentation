Steps Followed:
1. Setup Docker with help of Docker Desktop in Windows.
2. Enabled Kubernetes in Docker Desktop.
3. Setup Helm in powershell.
4. Created a nodejs example program and Dockerised, build and run it.
5. Setup ingress controller in Kubernetes.
6. Created Helm chart for the app and installed it in Kubernetes.
7. Used internal host ingress rule and updated in /etc/host file to check ingress use.
8. Make a change in Nodejs application and updated the helm chart.
9. Rollback the changes to old version of chart.

Challenges:
1. Faced challenge in upgrading the chart as I was upgrading without providing values.yaml file path.
2. Faced issue in configuring ingress rule.
3. Got confused in port and target port terms of services.

Explaination for Prod setup:
1. I would use more variables for better controll.
2. I would use condition in manifest file for specific requirements.
3. I would use resource limits and probes.
4. Using HPA will increase the scalability and availability.
